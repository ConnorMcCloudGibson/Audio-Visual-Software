#Audio-visual compositional environment (2nd tteration)
Collaboration in progress. Based on custom DSP library and API (which is being developed concurrently). Allows user to control custom audio synthesis and graphics generation engines using a tracker style compositional framework. Designed for use as a musical performance environment using the terminal for control of the application (see included image  "2Voice.png" for example of 2-voice implementation of the first iteration).
